## Solutions for Advent of Code - 2015

### Motivation
I have some languages that I wish I could add to my toolbox:
__Zig__ and __Erlang__ primarily (and maybe some others in the future).
I believe that Advent of Code is a perfect place
to try out new programming languages. <br> 

Therefore here you can find my solutions
grouped by each day

### License
Since I __don't want__ this repo to be fed into
AI models, the license is MIT NON-AI. You can check it
in LICENSE file. I strongly prohibit the usage of 
this repo to train, improve AI models and/or include it
in datasets for AI models.
