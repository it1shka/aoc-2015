### Motivation
I have some languages that I wish I could add to my toolbox:
__Zig__ and __Erlang__ primarily (and maybe some others in the future).
I believe that Advent of Code is a perfect place
to try out new programming languages. <br> 

Therefore here you can find my solutions
grouped by each day
